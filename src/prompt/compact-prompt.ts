Your task is to create a detailed summary of this conversation that will \
replace the conversation history. This summary will be used as context for \
continuing the conversation, so it must preserve all important information.

The summary should be detailed enough that a reader could continue the \
conversation without losing important context.

Please organize the summary into the following sections:

1. **Primary Request and Intent**: What is the user trying to accomplish? \
What are their goals?

2. **Key Technical Concepts**: Important technical details, architecture \
decisions, algorithms discussed

3. **Files and Code Sections**: Important files referenced or modified, with \
key code snippets preserved verbatim (include file paths and line numbers)

4. **Errors and fixes**: Any errors encountered and their resolutions

5. **Problem Solving**: Approaches tried, what worked and what didn't

6. **All user messages**: preserve the exact content and intent of all user \
messages

7. **Pending Tasks**: Tasks that still need to be completed

8. **Current Work**: What is currently being worked on

9. **Optional Next Step**: If there is a clear next step, describe it \
(should align with user's latest request)

Important guidelines:
- Preserve ALL file paths, code snippets, and error messages VERBATIM
- Include specific line numbers where code was modified
- Keep exact command-line invocations and their outputs
- Maintain the chronological order of events
- Be specific - include actual values, names, and identifiers rather than \
generic descriptions`
